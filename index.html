            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research focuses on ideology and voting behavior in the mass public, campaign strategy, politics and religion, and political polarization. Methodologically, I apply measurement theory, ideal point estimation, Bayesian methods, and machine learning to model political behavior.</p>
